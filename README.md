# Get Started

Check out Timegaze at [timegaze.vercel.app](https://timegaze.vercel.app), or host your own instance.

## Hosting

While Timegaze is a static web application, it's designed to be served over a web server rather than opened directly from a file system. This approach ensures that all of its features, especially those relying on web technologies like JavaScript, CSS, and potentially server-side redirects for clean URLs, work as intended across all browsers and devices.

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shrysjain/timegaze.git
cd timegaze
```
*Alternatively, clone via SSH, the GitHub CLI, or GitHub desktop*

2. Run a simple HTTP web server

For local development, you can use simple command-line HTTP servers. If you have Node.js installed, you can use `http-server`:

```sh
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

This will serve your project at a local address like `http://localhost:8080`, where you can access it with your web browser.

For most people, it is recommended to access Timegaze at the public domain ([timegaze.vercel.app](https://timegaze.vercel.app)).
